        "False",
        "True"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Saving is meant for short-term needs—like buying something soon or keeping money safe for emergencies. Savings grow slowly, so they’re best when you need the money within a few months or a couple of years."

        "False",
        "True"
      ],
      "correctIndex": 1,
      "explanation": "Investing is designed for long-term goals because it gives your money time to grow. Over many years, investments can increase in value much more than a savings account, making them perfect for big future goals like a car, university, or building wealth."

      "correctIndex": 2,
      "explanation": "The earlier you invest, the longer your money has to grow through compounding. Even small amounts invested early can become much larger over time."

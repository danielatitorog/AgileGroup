                    <h1><strong>Module 1: What Is Investing?</strong></h1>
                    <h2>What does investing mean?</h2>
                    <p>Investing is when you put your money into something that can grow in value over time.
                        A helpful way to think about it is like planting a smart money seed: it doesn’t grow instantly, and sometimes it might dip during bad weather, but over the long run it has the potential to grow into something much bigger. Instead of letting money sit still, investing puts it to work so it can help you reach future goals.</p>
                    <p>The key idea is that your money isn’t just sitting still anymore. It’s being used to help companies grow, build new products, or open new locations, and if things go well, you benefit from that growth too.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Module 1: What Is Investing?</strong></h1>
                    <h2>Why do investments grow?</h2>
                    <p>Investments grow mainly because companies grow. When businesses make more profit, expand, or become more popular, the value of their shares rises. Over long periods of time, entire economies get bigger, technology improves, and successful companies tend to earn more money.</p>
                    <p>This growth is reflected in the value of their stocks or funds. That’s why investing early and staying invested for a long time often leads to strong results—even with the ups and downs along the way.</p>

                    <h2>Risk vs Reward</h2>
                    <p>Every investment comes with some level of risk. Prices can rise and fall because of world events, company news, or changes in the economy. This can feel stressful at times, but it’s completely normal.</p>
                    <p>The important thing to know is that risk and reward are connected: safer investments usually grow slowly, while higher-risk investments can grow more—especially over many years. Smart investors learn how to balance both by diversifying and staying patient.</p>

                    <h2>Building wealth over time</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest advantages of investing is how much your money can grow over long periods. Even small amounts invested consistently can increase significantly thanks to compounding, the effect where your returns start earning returns of their own.</p>
                    <p>This is why starting young is such a superpower. The earlier you begin, the more time your investments have to multiply.</p>

                    <p>This is why funds are popular—they include many companies at once, giving you instant diversification with just a single purchase.</p>

                    <h2>Saving for big milestones</h2>
                    <p>Many major life events—like buying your first car, paying for university, or moving into your own place—require money. Investing can help you reach these goals faster than regular saving alone.</p>
                    <p>By planning ahead and investing early, you reduce stress later and give yourself more opportunities when these milestones arrive.</p>

                    <p>Time is the most powerful tool in investing. Even small amounts invested as a teenager can grow into something surprisingly large by adulthood because compounding multiplies your money the longer it sits.</p>
                    <p>Starting early doesn’t just give you more money—it gives you more time to learn, make decisions, and build confidence.</p>

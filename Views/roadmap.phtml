                    <h1><strong>Module 1: What Is Investing?</strong></h1>
                    <h2>What does investing mean?</h2>
                    <p>Investing is when you put your money into something that can grow in value over time.
                        A helpful way to think about it is like planting a smart money seed: it doesn’t grow instantly, and sometimes it might dip during bad weather, but over the long run it has the potential to grow into something much bigger. Instead of letting money sit still, investing puts it to work so it can help you reach future goals.</p>
                    <p>The key idea is that your money isn’t just sitting still anymore. It’s being used to help companies grow, build new products, or open new locations, and if things go well, you benefit from that growth too.</p>

                    <h1><strong>Module 1: What Is Investing?</strong></h1>
                    <h2>Why do investments grow?</h2>
                    <p>Investments grow mainly because companies grow. When businesses make more profit, expand, or become more popular, the value of their shares rises. Over long periods of time, entire economies get bigger, technology improves, and successful companies tend to earn more money.</p>
                    <p>This growth is reflected in the value of their stocks or funds. That’s why investing early and staying invested for a long time often leads to strong results—even with the ups and downs along the way.</p>

                    <h2>Risk vs Reward</h2>
                    <p>Every investment comes with some level of risk. Prices can rise and fall because of world events, company news, or changes in the economy. This can feel stressful at times, but it’s completely normal.</p>
                    <p>The important thing to know is that risk and reward are connected: safer investments usually grow slowly, while higher-risk investments can grow more—especially over many years. Smart investors learn how to balance both by diversifying and staying patient.</p>

                    <h2>Building wealth over time</h2>
                    <p>One of the biggest advantages of investing is how much your money can grow over long periods. Even small amounts invested consistently can increase significantly thanks to compounding, the effect where your returns start earning returns of their own.</p>
                    <p>This is why starting young is such a superpower. The earlier you begin, the more time your investments have to multiply.</p>

                    <p>A share represents a tiny piece of a company. When you buy one, you become a small owner of that business. If the company grows, earns more money, or becomes more popular, the value of your share usually increases.</p>

                    <p>The stock market is like a huge online marketplace where people buy and sell shares every second of the day. Prices constantly change based on supply and demand—how many people want to buy something versus how many want to sell it.</p>
                    <p>When lots of people believe a company will perform well, more buyers appear and the price goes up. When investors lose confidence, the price falls. These movements might seem random day to day, but over many years, the market has historically grown.</p>

                    <p>Diversification means spreading your money across many different investments instead of relying on just one. If one company has a bad year, your entire investment won’t collapse because the others can balance it out.</p>
                    <p>This is why funds are popular—they include many companies at once, giving you instant diversification with just a single purchase.</p>
